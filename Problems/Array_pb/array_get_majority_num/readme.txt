Find the majority element which appears more then n/2 times, on the contrary return 0.
A majority element in an array A[] of size n is an element that appears more than n/2 times (and hence there is at most one such element).

Input : {3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4}
Output : 4 

Input : {3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4}
